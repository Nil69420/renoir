//! Synchronization primitives for high-performance robotics applications
//!
//! This module provides lock-free synchronization patterns optimized for robotics use cases,
//! particularly Single Writer Multiple Reader (SWMR) scenarios common in sensor processing.
//!
//! Key features:
//! - Atomic sequence numbers with memory barriers for consistency
//! - SWMR ring buffers for sensor â†’ multiple consumers
//! - Epoch-based memory reclamation without expensive atomic ops on read path
//! - eventfd-based notifications for efficient wakeups
//! - No locks on hot path for maximum real-time performance
