## Description

Brief description of the changes in this PR.

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Performance optimization (improves performance without changing functionality)
- [ ] Documentation update (improves or adds documentation)
- [ ] CI/CD improvement (updates workflows, testing, or deployment processes)

## Embedded Systems Impact

### Target Hardware Tested
- [ ] Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM, ARM Cortex-A72)
- [ ] Jetson AGX Xavier (32GB RAM, ARM Cortex-A78AE)
- [ ] Generic ARM64 system
- [ ] x86_64 development system
- [ ] Cross-compilation only (no hardware testing)

### Performance Characteristics
- [ ] CPU usage remains under target thresholds (< 50% sustained)
- [ ] Memory usage is bounded and predictable
- [ ] Real-time constraints are maintained (< 1ms critical operations)
- [ ] Power efficiency considerations addressed

### Resource Usage
**Before this change:**
- CPU usage: _%
- Memory usage: _MB
- Test execution time: _ms

**After this change:**
- CPU usage: _%
- Memory usage: _MB  
- Test execution time: _ms

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] Performance tests added/updated
- [ ] Cross-compilation tests pass
- [ ] All existing tests pass

### Platform Testing
```bash
# Test commands used (example)
RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 cargo test --release
cargo test cpu_performance_tests --release
cargo test memory_performance_tests --release
cargo bench
```

**Test Results:**
- Total tests: _/98 passing
- New tests added: _
- Performance regression: None/Improved by _%/Degraded by _%

## Security

### Security Checks
- [ ] `cargo audit` passes (no vulnerabilities)
- [ ] `cargo deny check` passes (license compliance)
- [ ] `cargo geiger` shows no increase in unsafe code
- [ ] No sensitive information in commit history

### Dependency Changes
- [ ] No new dependencies added
- [ ] New dependencies are minimal and well-maintained
- [ ] Dependency versions are pinned appropriately

## Documentation

- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear variable/function names
- [ ] Public API changes are documented
- [ ] README.md updated if necessary
- [ ] Examples updated if API changes affect them
- [ ] Performance characteristics documented

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Compilation Targets
- [ ] `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` (Raspberry Pi 4, Jetson AGX Xavier)
- [ ] `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` (Raspberry Pi 3 and older)
- [ ] `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (static linking for embedded containers)
- [ ] `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (development systems)

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- [ ] ARM NEON optimizations utilized where appropriate
- [ ] Cache line alignment considered for ARM processors
- [ ] Memory barriers appropriate for weak memory models
- [ ] No x86-specific instructions or assumptions

## Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] Code passes linting checks (`cargo clippy`)  
- [ ] No compiler warnings in release mode
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and appropriate

### Embedded System Requirements
- [ ] No unbounded memory allocations
- [ ] No blocking operations in critical paths
- [ ] Resource cleanup is guaranteed
- [ ] Graceful degradation under memory pressure

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing workflows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no significant regression
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully
